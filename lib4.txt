Two [Word Not Submitted], both alike in dignity,
In fair [Word Not Submitted], where we lay our scene,
From ancient [Word Not Submitted] break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-cross`d [Word Not Submitted] take their life;
Whole misadventured piteous overthrows
Do with their [Word Not Submitted] bury their parents` strife.
The fearful passage of their [Word Not Submitted] love,
And the continuance of their parents` rage,
Which, but their children`s end, nought could [Word Not Submitted],
Is now the [Word Not Submitted] hours` traffic of our stage;
The which if you with [Word Not Submitted] [Word Not Submitted] attend,
What here shall [Word Not Submitted], our toil shall strive to mend.
